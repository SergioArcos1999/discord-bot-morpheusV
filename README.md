# MorpheusV bot 

## How to run it on a server


1. Run shadowJar task on Gradle.
2. This will generate a .jar file located at the _out_ directory.
3. Get the .jar file and copy it to the server.
4. Use the next command to run the application:
```
java -jar D:\Workspace\discord-bot-morpheusV\out\artifacts\discord_bot_morpheusV_jar\discord-bot-morpheusV.jar
```

Of course, you will need the Java version installed on the server to run this.

Enjoy.
